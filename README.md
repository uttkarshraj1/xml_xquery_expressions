# Xml Xquery Expressions

1) This coursework involves writing some XQuery expressions to extract useful information from some real XML data.

2) The coursework must be performed individually.

3) Download the example files cw2files.zip. These are real datafiles from the British National Corpus, a collection of English language data widely used by linguists and computational linguists, together with a schema. There is a full explanation of the schema1, but the important parts here are:

a) <s> represents a sentence, containing possibly many children <w> representing words in linear order;
  
b) <w> YYY </w> represents word YYY.
